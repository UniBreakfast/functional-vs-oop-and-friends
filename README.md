Moving object on a field

This is a simple game where you move an object on a field. 
The object can move in 4 directions: up, down, left and right. 
The object can't move outside the field.

We will create different implementations:

- Procedural
- Functional
- Object Oriented (with premade objects)
- Object Oriented (with functions-constructors)
- Object Oriented (with classes)
  
other possible implementations:

- with outsourcing to libraries, modules, etc.
- under framework control
